1. `cd` to the `instructure-security-package` folder
2. Run `pnpm i` for inital setup
3. Eun `pnpm run dev` to start local server
4. Edit allthethings
5. run `pnpm push` when finished (deploys to `gh-pages` branch and serves at [inst.bid](https://inst.bid))

**protip:** use `pnpm preview` to test the statically generated version before `push`ing.
